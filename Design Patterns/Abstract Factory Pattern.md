What is the Abstract Factory Pattern?

It is like a factory, but everything is encapsulated
    The method that orders the object
    The factories that build the object
    The final objects
    The final objects contain objects that use the Strategy Pattern
        Composition: Object class fields are objects

What can you do with an abstract factory?

Allows you to create families of related objects without specifying a concrete class
Use when you have many objects that can be added, or changed dynamically during runtime
You can model anything you can image and have those objects interact through common interfaces
The Bad: Things can get complicated

Watch Factory Pattern Simplified example in video

public static void main(String[] args)
tells us that this is the main application where everything is going to be running inside of here

Then watch the Simply the Abstract Factory section of the video
